Automatic Abstract Template Generator

The project will investigate ways to extract language patterns (keywords, common phrases and structures, etc.) from about 30,000 PhD dissertation abstracts in different disciplines (Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Life Sciences, Physical Sciences) and develop a writing template generator that automatically produces various abstract structures for students to improve skills in writing abstracts or summaries. Solid programming skills in Python and sound knowledge in machine learning are essential. You will experience natural language processing techniques like word embedding and text generation.
